# Programming_Concept

Hello Gentleman,
                welcome to my Programming concept repository. This repo contains some code examples
which will help you to understand some typical concepts or terms of programming languages specially
C, C++ and Java. Well I personally love C and C++. To be expert in these languages one must have 
decent understanding of pointers, array, recursion, memory visualization, stack etc. These is not the
only you have studied till now, don't worry I will help you to dive into the depth of the pointers and
all these stuffs because this is the building block of any programming languages.
